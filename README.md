The easiest way to easily create UI.
Konstruct is built to simplify UI creation without taking away the quality. UI doesn't have to be difficult, and that's the main thing I want to show with this module.
The module is powerful while staying easy-to-understand, so that any new user can get the hang of it in under 5 minutes.
